# Game of life
my implementation of game of life using rust and macroquad.

## controls:
- space: to pause and play the simulation
- left mouse click (while the game is paused): to flip the state of squares 
- left arrow: advance the simulation by one step
- up arrow: increase the simulation speed
- down arrow: decrease the simulation speed
